My solutions of LeetCode in Modern C++

First of all LeetCode handcaps C++ by using `-O2` and using dead function parameters.

I've more than one solutions for problems which I'll also keep updating as I find better ways to solve a problem

I also try to avoid recursion so most the problems use Iterative apporach.
